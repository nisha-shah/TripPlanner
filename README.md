# Steps : 
1. Start rails server.  
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/trips/list  
3. Observe the 'list' page: It has the nav bar from the layout and lists all the trips from the database.  
4. Clicking on the 'New Trip' button, opens the modal for creating a new trip. Enter trip name and upload image.   Click on 'Submit' button.  
5. Clicking on the 'Submit' button creats a new record in the database.
